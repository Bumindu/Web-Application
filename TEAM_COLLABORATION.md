## Communication

### Communication Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Response Time |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| GitHub Issues | Bug reports, feature requests, task tracking | Within 24 hours |
| GitHub Discussions | Technical discussions, architecture decisions | Within 48 hours |
| Slack | Quick questions, daily standups, urgent matters | Within 4 hours during work hours |
| Email | External communication, formal announcements | Within 24 hours |
| Video Calls | Sprint planning, retrospectives, complex discussions | Scheduled in advance |

### Communication Guidelines

1. **Be Clear and Concise**
   - Use clear subject lines
   - State your purpose upfront
   - Use bullet points for multiple items

2. **Choose the Right Channel**
   - Technical discussions → GitHub Discussions
   - Quick questions → Slack
   - Bugs/features → GitHub Issues
   - Sensitive matters → Private channels or direct messages

3. **Status Updates**
   - Daily updates in the team Slack channel
   - Weekly progress reports via email
   - Update GitHub Issues with current status

4. **Availability**
   - Set your working hours in your calendar
   - Use status indicators in Slack
   - Notify the team of planned absences at least 48 hours in advance

5. **Async Communication Best Practices**
   - Provide context in your messages
   - Include screenshots or recordings when explaining issues
   - Tag specific people when their input is needed

## Git Workflow

We follow a modified Git Flow workflow:

### Branches

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features or enhancements
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes for production
- `release/*`: Release preparation

### Branch Naming Convention

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Examples:
- `feature/42-user-authentication`
- `bugfix/57-fix-login-error`
- `hotfix/63-security-vulnerability`

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Examples:
- `feat(auth): implement JWT authentication`
- `fix(ui): resolve button alignment in chat window`
- `docs(api): update endpoint documentation`

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch from `develop` (for features/bugfixes) or `main` (for hotfixes)
2. Develop and test your changes locally
3. Push your branch to the remote repository
4. Create a Pull Request using the PR template
5. Request reviews from at least two team members
6. Address review feedback
7. Merge only after receiving approvals and passing all checks

## Code Review Process

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies added
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate

### Review Guidelines

1. **Be Timely**
   - Respond to review requests within 24 hours
   - For urgent fixes, prioritize reviews

2. **Be Thorough**
   - Check for logic errors
   - Verify test coverage
   - Consider edge cases
   - Look for security issues

3. **Be Constructive**
   - Explain why changes are needed
   - Suggest alternatives when possible
   - Praise good solutions
   - Use "we" instead of "you"

4. **Focus on Important Issues**
   - Distinguish between must-fix and nice-to-have
   - Don't nitpick on style if it follows guidelines
   - Consider the context and urgency

### Review Process

1. Author creates PR and assigns reviewers
2. Reviewers provide feedback within 24 hours
3. Author addresses feedback and requests re-review
4. Once approved by at least two reviewers, author can merge
5. For complex changes, consider pair programming sessions

## Issue Tracking

We use GitHub Issues for tracking bugs, features, and tasks.

### Issue Types

- **Bug**: Something isn't working as expected
- **Feature**: New functionality
- **Enhancement**: Improvement to existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates
- **Technical Debt**: Code improvements, refactoring
- **Security**: Security-related issues

### Issue Template

Each issue should include:

- Clear title describing the issue
- Detailed description
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs. actual behavior (for bugs)
- Screenshots or videos (if applicable)
- Environment details (browser, OS, etc.)
- Severity/priority level
- Assignee (if known)
- Labels

### Issue Workflow

1. **Triage**: New issues are reviewed and categorized
2. **Prioritization**: Issues are assigned priority levels
3. **Assignment**: Issues are assigned to team members
4. **Implementation**: Work begins on the issue
5. **Review**: Changes are reviewed
6. **Closure**: Issue is closed after verification

### Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Must be fixed immediately (production blockers)
- **High**: Should be fixed in the current sprint
- **Medium**: Should be addressed in the next 1-2 sprints
- **Low**: Nice to have, can be scheduled for future sprints

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript functions and classes
- Document complex algorithms with comments
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Document public APIs thoroughly

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Authenticates a user with the provided credentials
 * 
 * @param {string} username - The user's username or email
 * @param {string} password - The user's password
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} User data and authentication token
 * @throws {AuthError} If authentication fails
 */
async function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Project Documentation

- README.md: Project overview, setup instructions, basic usage
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Contribution guidelines
- API.md: API documentation
- ARCHITECTURE.md: System architecture and design decisions
- DEPLOYMENT.md: Deployment procedures

### Documentation Location

- Code documentation: In the code files
